Future Directions
-----------------

Smap Server supports completing surveys using web forms as well as on Android devices.  This isn't as mature as as the Android client however it does already support an updated version of the Task Management API. 

##### Get existing survey data as an XForm instance XML file
https://hostname/instanceXML/{survey id}/0?datakey={key name}&datakeyvalue={value of key}

##### Update existing results
https://{hostname}/submission/{instanceid}

Note the instance id of the existing data is included in the instanceXML.  It should be replaced with a new instance id before the results are submitted. However the instance id of the data to be replaced needs to be included in teh submission URL.

This API allows you to maintain data using surveys. In the following video the data is published on a map, however it could also be published in a table as a patient registry or list of assets. fieldTask needs to be customised to access these links using the data keys in a similar way to web forms.
